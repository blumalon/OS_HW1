Operating Systems — HW1 Test Suite (Winter 2026)

This repository contains manually written test cases designed to validate the smash shell implementation for HW1 (Winter 2026).

To run all tests, simply execute:

python3 run_tests.py


Important:
Clone this repository into the same directory that contains the original
*.cpp and *.h files provided by the course staff
(smash.cpp, Commands.cpp, signals.cpp, etc.).
The test runner automatically compiles your smash program before running the tests.

If you discover any mistake or inconsistency in the tests, feel free to open an issue or contact me.
